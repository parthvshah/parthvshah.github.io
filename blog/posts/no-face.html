                    <p>You hold up your hand and check the time. You still have another 40 minutes before boarding
                        begins. You have always been early to the airport, a habit you acquired from your father. As you
                        stroll to your gate, you notice something peculiar. At first, you think it is a lucky
                        coincidence and focus on the music playing through your earphones. You love this new band from
                        Auckland. But as you walk around, peering to your left and right, it becomes more and more
                        evident. "Am I dreaming?", you think to yourself as you try not to stare. Slowly, you can feel a
                        pit forming in your stomach. As panic sets in, you abruptly stop walking and your hands fumble
                        around in your carry on. You pull out a small device in disbelief and your worst fears are
                        confirmed.</p>

                    <p>Everyone around you is engrossed in the same, matte black device that your slightly trembling
                        hands are now holding. It's no bigger than a Kindle but weighs slightly more. You can now see
                        people around you scrolling on this device, some with their index finger, some with their thumb
                        as they blankly stare into it. There are no smooth edges and no buttons on it. As you turn it in
                        your hand to inspect it, there is a dim glow that bounces off your face as the screen lights up.
                        It's here. </p>

                    <p>You still cannot believe it. These state-issued devices are the only authorized means for the
                        consumption of written media now. Any book, magazine, blog post, news article, opinion, message
                        you "wish" to read must be through this. Since the advent of the virtualization of hardware
                        devices and instant remote delivery, you are not surprised to find it in your bag. You knew this
                        day was coming but how did it come so soon? Only a few months ago, the Chancellor had promised
                        bilateral discussions concerning the new censorship laws. Does this mean we lost? Who are we
                        anyway? As the pit in your stomach deepens, you realize that you will never get to peek at what
                        the person across from you on the bus was reading. You remember how you loved looking around and
                        observing what others were reading, trying to guess a part of their personality based on the
                        book they were reading. This lacklustre device is all that you will ever see now. Was someone
                        reading Dante or Tolstoy? Are they reading an opinionated piece or some propaganda? What about
                        all the colourful book and magazine covers? What about chance finds? Multiple times, a
                        stranger's book had piqued your interest and you had found out more about that author or that
                        genre. You find yourself shaking your head partly to get these awful thoughts out of your head,
                        partly in disbelief. Apart from the fact that reading will become fully anonymous, you can never
                        be sure of what you are reading on this medium. Is it authentic or altered? Even if it is the
                        same news article, are you and your next-door-neighbour reading the same text or is it
                        personally tailored to elicit a specific response from you? You shove the device back into your
                        bag and out of the corner of your eye, you see thousands of these devices lining the walls of a
                        shop. Your mouth hangs open. They sit on the racks of this shop, in hundreds of rows, forming a
                        huge, black wall. Additional devices with no face as if anyone would ever want more than one of
                        these. You feel sick.</p>
