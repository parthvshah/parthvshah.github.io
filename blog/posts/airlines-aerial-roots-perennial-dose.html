                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Dose</h2>

                    <p>Tucked away on a busy Lavelle Road, Airlines Hotel serves a variety of dishes including
                        delectable South Indian snacks. Amongst these is the humble masala dose. Paired with their rich
                        and dark filter coffee, I guarantee that you will leave this place with a wide smile on your
                        face as if you have arrived at the destination of your long-awaited vacation. The dose was a
                        perfect golden brown with the red chutney inside and was served with sambhar and coconut
                        chutney. It was light and airy. After a momentary dip in the heavenly sambhar, it sure did cause
                        a turbulence of flavours in my mouth. My tastebuds fastened their seatbelts for the next morsel.
                        Delicious.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Dose?</h2>

                    <p>Recently while walking on a bustling Church Street one Saturday evening, I felt a thin veil of
                        sadness drape over me. As I squeezed past people on the sidewalk, I could hear a lot more Hindi,
                        Marathi and Bengali than I had before. It should not have come to me as a surprise. As the
                        pandemic wanes, multitudes of people who were hired remotely from all over the country have
                        moved into Bengaluru. For this already populous yet extremely welcoming city, I wonder how many
                        more people she can home. You must have heard about her infamous traffic jams, her water woes
                        and unaffordable housing but it has only gotten worse. Yet, people come streaming in. The
                        Silicon Valley of India. A little introspection as I begin eating my dose reveals the source of
                        my mild melancholy. Bengaluru is not mine anymore. Neither is she yours. She is ours and we
                        share her now more than ever. This metropolis has always been an abode for immigrants from all
                        over the state and country. But now as I see new immigrants talk about how perfectly pleasant
                        the weather is on their stroll through Cubbon Park or talk about the startup they work for while
                        enjoying a darshini filter coffee, I feel like a child who is being forced to share his sparkly
                        new toy with a friend during playtime. I should be happy that so many more people are going to
                        be enchanted by this beautiful city and bask in all she has to offer. But I'm scared she will
                        lose her charm. I'm scared she won't be the Bengaluru I know and grew up in. These thoughts
                        flood my head and as a first-generation city immigrant myself, I attempt to undrape this veil.
                        Just like my parents did some twenty-five years ago, these people are here for better
                        opportunities or to advance their careers or simply for the challenge a change in cities
                        entails. Whatever it is, I know one thing for sure. Bengaluru has a huge heart. Her stunning
                        sunsets and tiffin rooms are for everyone. Now more than ever.</p>
