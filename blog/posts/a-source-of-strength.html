                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p>Dear Madhulika Aunty, </br>
                        Hope you and your family are doing well and staying safe. I wanted to share a thought with you
                        as our country and world tackles this crisis. Some learnings are so deeply etched in me and I am
                        so grateful to the teachers at Sishu Griha, especially you, for them.</p>

                    <p>Two days ago, I caught myself thinking about the reaction young, elementary children would have
                        to this pandemic. I'm sure they are afraid or do not fully understand the situation. I'm sure
                        they are wondering how this would affect them or their parents, teachers and friends. I'm sure
                        they are waiting for this crisis to blow over and catch a glimpse of good news. </p>

                    <p>That got me thinking if I ever felt this way at a young age. Was I scared watching a situation
                        unfold in front of my eyes? Was I afraid during a past national or global crisis as a
                        young boy? Immediately my thoughts go to 2008, when I was in 4th grade and you were my
                        class teacher. As the horrific attacks on Mumbai unfolded on the 26th of November, I clearly
                        remember coming to school, timidly sitting in 4D, feeling uneasy due to the uncertainty. I
                        vividly
                        remember you spending the first 20 minutes, our reading hour, to dispel all fear in our minds.
                        Your calm disposition and matter-of-fact tone ensured that all of us were once again at ease. I
                        remember you patiently explaining the current situation including the possible causes and
                        repercussions. As I recall this, I am deeply moved. I remember feeling comfortable and
                        confident once again to take on more of the difficult news that was being shared via the media.
                        I am only perceiving the full impact of this now as I bravely face this new crisis and wonder at
                        the
                        source of my strength.</p>

                    <p>You have been a very influential teacher in not just my life but in the lives of hundreds of
                        children as they spend their formative years in Sishu Griha. I only pray that students all
                        around the nation and world have the good fortune of having such influential teachers like you.
                        Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

                    <p>With love, </br> Parth Shah</p>
